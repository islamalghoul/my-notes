## Part 1   
**Data structure**
data structures, which are the different ways that we can organize our data; variables, arrays, hashes, and objects are all types of data structures

**Linear data structures**
which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed


**Memory management**
The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines


**Parts of a linked list**
A linked list is made up of a series of nodes, which are the elements of the list



## Part 2
**Linked lists**
Linked lists are super simple, but they seem to have this reputation of being fairly complicated

**what even is Big O?**
But Big O is really all over and omnipresent within computer science
