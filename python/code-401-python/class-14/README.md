# Web Scraping
Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website

Important notes about web scraping:
1-Read through the websiteâ€™s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data. Most sites prohibit you from using the data for commercial purposes.
2-Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. You may potentially be blocked from the site as well.
