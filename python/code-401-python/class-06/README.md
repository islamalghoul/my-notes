    ## Software Design Patterns Simplified
    why design patterns exist?Developers have noticed that they seemed to be approaching problems in similar ways in a bunch of different software’s, then they decided that it would be pretty useful to be able to talk about those approaches using a common vocabulary, so they wouldn’t have to keep explaining what they were referring to. Thus they figured out general versions of these common practices and gave them names like “Adapter” and “Singleton.”
    A design pattern is only a description or template for how to solve a problem! that can be used in many different situations

    ### Programming Paradigms:
    A way to classify programming languages based on their coding styles and features. Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language
    ### Architectural Patterns:
    Reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context. They are similar to software design pattern but have a broader scope
    ### Design Patterns : 
    Reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design within a given context. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations
    ### Design Principles:
    Represent a set of guidelines that help developers to avoid having a bad design. Writing code according to proven principles helps achieving code maintainability and simplicity

    ### There is 3 major types of design patterns:
    Creational Patterns,Structural Patterns,Behavioral Patterns

    ## What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?
    Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done
    ## Why use Risk Analysis?
    In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions

    ##  you must know there are certain risks that are unavoidable:
    1-The time that you allocated for testing

    2-A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application

    3-Urgency from the clients to deliver the project

    4-Incomplete requirements

    ## what  is dependency Injection, and when to use it?
    dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object. A dependency is an object that can be used (a service).

    ### There are basically three types of dependency injection:
    1-constructor injection: the dependencies are provided through a class constructor.

    2-setter injection: the client exposes a setter method that the injector uses to inject the dependency.

    3-interface injection: the dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client passed to it. Clients must implement an interface that exposes a setter method that accepts the dependency.
