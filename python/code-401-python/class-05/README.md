# Classes and Objects
Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.
You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class




# Thinking Recursively in Python
Problems (in life and also in computer science) can often seem big and scary. But if we keep chipping away at them, more often than not we can break them down into smaller chunks trivial enough to solve

## Maintaining State    

When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution contex

## Recursive Data Structures in Python
A data structure is recursive if it can be deﬁned in terms of a smaller version of itself. A list is an example of a recursive data structure
# Python Testing with pytest: Fixtures and Coverage
Software developers don't just write software; they also use software. So, they're the first to recognize, and understand, that software is complex and inevitably contains bugs.

But, just because bugs are inevitable doesn't mean that developers can or should try to prevent them. And, thus, during the past few decades, there's been rapid growth in software testing. Testing is no longer seen as an optional or "nice to have" part of software development; it's considered an absolute must—part of the software development process. In many cases, the people in the Python courses I teach at various companies aren't developers per se, but instead testers—people with the full-time job of writing tests to ensure that the company's software is robust.
I started looking at "pytest", a framework for testing Python programs that's really changed the way I look at testing. For the first time, I really feel like testing is something I can and should do on a regular basis; pytest makes things so easy and straightforward
